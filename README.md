This repository contain my assignment code

Hello team,
I create a web API  in which we can add a product,delete a product,update a product,and search a product by id.
body schema:
{
    "ProductName": "Pen",
    "Descripiton": "Blue Ball Pen",
    "Price": 10,
    "Quantity": 10
}

Before starting please change connection string in webconfig file

To test all crud mention in assignment please see below details:

To Get all Products use: https://localhost:44348/Products/GetProducts

To Get Product by id use: https://localhost:44348/Products/GetProduct/2

To ADD new Product: https://localhost:44348/Products/addProduct

To Update a Product By ID: https://localhost:44348/Product/Update/2

To Delete a Product By ID: https://localhost:44348/Products/DeleteProduct/1

To Test all APIS use I used Postman

Time taken by me:
Git: Half Hour because never use git before I know TFS
MockApi : 2 hours Try to use but unable understand how to use it.
Application: 1 Hour
Testing: 1 hours, try to implement but due to lack knowledge of testing couldn't complete.
